# kMIS
Instances generate by Gilbert' model.

Graph G=(L \cup R, E), with L a collection of subsets of a set R. L \cup R are vertices and E edges.

We generate 3 types of instances.

Type 1: |L| = |R|
Type 2: |L| > |R|
Type 3: |L| < |R|

In each type of instance we will have 3 groups. Each group indicates the density of the graph.
Groups 1, 2 and 3 with low, medium and high density, respectively.

In each file, the first line will contain |L| |R| |E|.
From the second line, we will have the edges of the graph (u,v) with u \in L and v \in R.
